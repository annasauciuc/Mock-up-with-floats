                <h3>Leonid Afremov painting</h3>
                <p>Leonid Afremov is a Russian–Israeli modern impressionistic artist who works mainly with a palette knife
                    and oils.Almost every painting he painted has a very personal inspiration. His art can be reflected as
                    very positive through the bright colors he uses.</p>

                <h3>Leonid Afremov painting</h3>
                <p>He developed his own unique technique and style which is unmistakable and cannot be confused with other
                    artists. Afremov is mainly known as being a self-representing artist who promotes and sells his work
                    exclusively over the internet with very little exhibitions and involvement of dealers and galleries..</p>

                <h3>Leonid Afremov painting</h3>
                <p> Leonid Afremov has been traveling quite extensively and has taken many photographs of different scenes
                    that he later painted. Almost every painting he painted has a very personal inspiration. His art can
                    be reflected as very positive through the bright colors he uses.

                <h3>Leonid Afremov painting</h3>
                <p>Leonid Afremov keeps the majority of his art politically neutral. His paintings are not offensive to anyone
                    nor send any hidden messages. The paintings usually reflect certain personal memories and emotions..

                <h3>Leonid Afremov painting</h3>
                <p> Leonid Afremov tries to draw the viewer to have a certain feeling rather than tell a story via the painting,
                    or have the viewer see the world how he sees it. The neutral attributes of Afremov’s art make the paintings
                    appealing to almost any social, ethnic and age group.

                <h3>Leonid Afremov painting</h3>
                <p>The only political paintings he has are of bull-fighting , where he tries to show the viewer the cruel
                    nature of the sport and discourage the viewers from liking bull-fighting.</p>
